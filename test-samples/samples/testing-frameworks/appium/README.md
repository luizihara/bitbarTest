# Appium

Bitbar Cloud support both - Client and Server (Cloud) side testing.

## Client Side

Client Side means that you are running test locally (on your machine), but using our devices.

Currently we have samples for:

* [C#](client-side/csharp/)
* [Java](client-side/java/)
* [JavaScript (Node.js)](client-side/javascript/)
* [Python 3](client-side/python/)
* [Ruby](client-side/ruby/)

## Server Side

Server Side means that you need to prepare package with your tests and upload it to our Cloud.
We are taking care for the rest.

Currently we have samples for:

* [Java](server-side/java/)
* [JavaScript (Node.js)](server-side/javascript/)
* [Python 3](server-side/python/)
* [Ruby](server-side/ruby/)
